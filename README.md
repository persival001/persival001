<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm JÃ©rÃ©my</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate developer from France</h3>


I am passionate about Android mobile application development, specializing in the use of Kotlin and Java. 
Using a structured MVVM approach, I design efficient and maintainable applications. 
Recently, I embarked on the Compose adventure to enrich my skills in UI/UX development, leading to the creation of several personal projects. 
These initiatives allowed me to refine my mastery of Compose and explore new ways to create intuitive and responsive user interfaces.

My journey is marked by a constant quest for improvement and innovation, where I apply best development practices and the latest technologies to deliver exceptional user experiences. 
I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to push the limits of what I can create with Android. 
Take a look at my projects to get an overview of my work and progress.

Welcome to my world of Android development, where curiosity meets creativity and technology.
