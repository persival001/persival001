<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm JÃ©rÃ©my</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate developer from France</h3>


I am passionate about Android mobile application development, specializing in the use of Kotlin and Java.<br> 
Using a structured MVVM approach, I design efficient and maintainable applications. <br>
Recently, I embarked on the Compose adventure to enrich my skills in UI/UX development, leading to the creation of several personal projects. <br>
These initiatives allowed me to refine my mastery of Compose and explore new ways to create intuitive and responsive user interfaces.<br>
My journey is marked by a constant quest for improvement and innovation, where I apply best development practices and the latest technologies to deliver exceptional user experiences. <br>
I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to push the limits of what I can create with Android. <br>
Take a look at my projects to get an overview of my work and progress.<br>
<br>
Welcome to my world of Android development, where curiosity meets creativity and technology.<br>
